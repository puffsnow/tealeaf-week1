arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq

#4.What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.
Ans. map is do something for the elements in array. For example, I have an array arr = [1, 2, 3], I want an array that all the element plus 1, I will use map like arr.map{|x| x + 1}
     select is find something correspond condition for the elements in array. For example, I have an array arr = [1, 2, 3], I want to find the element bigger than 1.5, I will use select like arr.select{|x| x > 1.5}

#5.Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?
Ans. Just fill the string to bracket, like a["Bee"] = 4

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
puts x
